## Live Demo

You can see the live demo of this project at [https://alexandruarmas.github.io/PORT3/](https://alexandruarmas.github.io/PORT3/).

## React Router v7 Compatibility

This project uses React Router v6 with future flags enabled to ensure compatibility with the upcoming React Router v7 release:

```jsx
<BrowserRouter future={{ v7_startTransition: true, v7_relativeSplatPath: true }}>
  <Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<LandingPage />} />
    <Route path="/project/:id" element={<ProjectPageLayout />} />
  </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>
```

The future flags address:
- `v7_startTransition`: Enables React Router to wrap state updates in React.startTransition
- `v7_relativeSplatPath`: Changes how relative paths are resolved within splat routes
